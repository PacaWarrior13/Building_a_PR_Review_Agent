This is the *Building a PR Review Agent* project I made myself.


<p>In this project, you’ll build a multi-agent AI system that taps into GitHub’s API to pull code diffs, test outcomes, and dependency data. It then uses this information to catch obvious mistakes—lint violations, missing tests, and vulnerability flags—and produces a short, clear comment for each pull request. Finally, it posts the review back to GitHub<strong>,</strong> so reviewers can dedicate their effort to the deeper review<strong> </strong>tasks.</p>
